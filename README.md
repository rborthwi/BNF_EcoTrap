# BNF_EcoTrap

This repository is the location for the data and scripts used to develop a publication on cerulean warblers and the potential for Bankhead National Forest to serve as an ecological trap.

The repository contains the source data under the folder "data" and the R scripts used for the manipulation of said data in the "scripts" folder.
All scripts are numbered based on order of use. The scripts labeled "00_" are data manipulation, and can be skipped (as the final products will be saved in data, where they will be sourced in subsequent scripts). They are included for prosterity.
